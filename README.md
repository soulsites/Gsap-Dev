Basic WP Plugin
===============

With this project I want to create an easy to use starting point to develop WP plugins.

Until now I use this basics:

- psr4 (OOP, composer, autoload, namespaces)
- Carbon Fields to create nice Setting Pages
- Webpack for JS modules

Goal is to have the best Starting Point for any WP plugin.

Anybody is welcome to join.
